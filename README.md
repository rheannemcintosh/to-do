## Project Overview
The To Do Application allows a user to manage their perosnal to do list, with the use of epics, tasks, sub-tasks and habits!

### Inspiration
I've also been a list maker since I was young, and I have never found an application that does everything I want it to do. Therefore I decided to make my own!
